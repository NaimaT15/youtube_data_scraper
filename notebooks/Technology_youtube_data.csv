As Financial Freestyle with Ross Mac wraps up its first full season, we‚Äôre revisiting some of the show‚Äôs most inspiring and forward-thinking moments. Ross Mac has used his platform to amplify the voices of several key figures, sharing insightful conversations that challenge perspectives and promote innovation. First, Mac welcomed New York Times bestselling author, Dream Machine Innovation Lab founder, and CNN contributor Van Jones. Known for his lifelong work as a lawyer and news commentator, Jones has shifted focus to tech advocacy. He believes technology, particularly AI, is a powerful tool for creating opportunities in overlooked communities. While many still struggle to understand AI, Jones sees it as a ‚Äúgreat equalizer.‚Äù ‚ÄúPeople keep telling me, well, Van Jones, you keep talking about this stuff, but 99% of Black people don't know anything about AI, 99% of Black kids don't know anything about AI,‚Äù Jones continues. ‚ÄúI say, you know what? You're correct. And 99% of white folk don't either. 99% of white children don't either, which means this is the first time you're ever [going to] experience something called equality.‚Äù Next, we heard Wemimo Abbey‚Äôs once-in-a-generation story. Abbey, co-founder of Esusu, a fintech company focused on credit-building solutions, shared his vision. ‚ÄúNo matter where you come from, the color of your skin or your financial identity [it] shouldn't determine where you end up in the wealthiest nation the world is ever in,‚Äù Abbey reflects. Esusu‚Äôs mission challenges traditional financial systems by enabling renters to build credit for on-time rent payments, similar to mortgage practices. This groundbreaking approach helped Esusu become one of the few Black unicorns in Silicon Valley. ‚ÄúThere are only 12 Black unicorns in the world (companies valued over a billion dollars),‚Äù Abbey says. ‚ÄúBut getting to that point was really painful. 326 investors said no to us because they didn't believe that‚Ä¶ creating win-win solutions for low-to-medium-income people was investible or could become a billion-dollar company. But we proved them wrong.‚Äù Finally, Mac revisited his conversation with Chris Lyons, president of Web3 Media at a16z. Lyons emphasized blockchain‚Äôs disruptive potential and broke down the evolution of the internet from Web1 to Web3. ‚ÄúIf you look at the app store right now, it's literally the same 15, 20 companies that constantly stay at the top of the charts because we have this infrastructure that is currently just literally stable‚Ä¶ defaulted in terms of innovation,‚Äù Lyons explained. ‚ÄúBut blockchain technologies are [going to] really open and unlock this next, this wave, which is Web3, which is what we consider ownership. So read, write, and own, which is the third layer.‚Äù Financial Freestyle with Ross Mac on Yahoo Finance is dedicated to promoting economic prosperity for all. Through expert insights, practical advice, and inspiring success stories, we empower you to build and grow wealth. Join us on this transformative journey toward financial freedom and inclusive economic growth.

Before the year 2000, if you wanted to make a lot of money in a predictable career you needed a nice suit and an important looking business card. Your options where finance, medicine, law or senior company management if you were lucky. 


But then‚Ä¶ just a few years later at around about the same time as those people in their fancy suits were blowing up the global economy a new breed of millionaire was entering the mainstream. 

They replaced the puffer vests and Bloomberg terminals with flip flops and vim terminals‚Ä¶ 

Tech bro‚Äôs worked fewer hours, had better perks and in many cases made better money than their peers in more traditional high-income roles‚Ä¶

What‚Äôs more is that people didn‚Äôt hate them‚Ä¶ 

Executives, bankers and their fancy lawyers were rightfully blamed for enriching themselves by leeching off a broken system that cost people their homes, their jobs, and their futures‚Ä¶ 

Meanwhile people loved the idea of hacky sack playing nerds making millions by actually making stuff that improved our lives‚Ä¶ 

But now‚Ä¶ 15 years later the tech bros became everything they promised to destroy‚Ä¶ and they kind of destroyed themselves in the process‚Ä¶

For a while you could have a great degree of confidence in becoming filthy rich by putting in a few years at a major Silicon Valley tech company‚Ä¶ but this all relied on a stream of money that wasn‚Äôt coming from nowhere‚Ä¶ 

Venture capital, the firms that ACTUALLY invest in early-stage start-ups to develop their new technology NEVER again actually reached the level of financing it did during the dot com bubble. 

That was‚Ä¶ until something changed in 2021‚Ä¶ 

So it‚Äôs time to learn How Money Works to find out how Tech Bro‚Äôs ruined tech for themselves‚Ä¶",How Money Works,"['tech industry', 'tech investing', 'biggest tech companies', 'tech layoffs', 'best companies to work for', 'coding career', 'tech industry career', 'how much do coders make', 'how much do google coders make', 'venture capital', 'technology venture capital', 'rise and fall of tech bros', 'how money works', 'how history works', 'tech career', 'is coding a good career', 'computer science career', 'highest paying companies']",27,2024-09-12T14:36:48Z,PT11M36S,1337408,3177,False,

(easy) #technology #tech #shorts,"This disgusting PC is in my repair shop because my customer is converting over to a laptop, and they want me to clone their data. Then we can have it for free so we can donate it to someone in need. But first we need to clean it. The most common reason technology fails, from gaming computers, to workstation laptops, is due to lack of maintenance. If your tech gets slow after being on for a few minutes, it's worth checking the CPU heatsink first to see if it's overheating. Keeping your computer clean is key to having a fast machine. My customer now has a great ThinkPad and this computer is up and running for someone who needs it.",Salem Techsperts,[],28,2024-04-14T13:28:21Z,PT59S,1871264,1156,False,

Curtis is the third studio album by American rapper 50 Cent; it was released on September 11, 2007, by Shady Records, Aftermath Entertainment and Interscope Records. The album features production from Dr. Dre, Eminem, and Timbaland, among others. Music writers have noted that 50 Cent divides between ""hard"" and ""soft"" songs on the album.

Curtis received generally mixed reviews from music critics upon release. The album debuted at number 2 on the US Billboard 200 chart, selling 691,000 copies in its first week. After years of slumping sales, the album's competition with Kanye West's Graduation (2007) and the resulting record breaking performances both albums displayed was considered to be a ""great day for hip hop.""

Williams X Jet

The Williams X-Jet, developed by Williams International, was a small, single-person, lightweight vertical take-off and landing aircraft powered by a modified Williams F107 turbofan engine ‚Äî designated WR-19-7 ‚Äî with some minor modifications. Because of its design, the craft was dubbed ""The Flying Pulpit"". It was designed to transport one operator and be controlled by leaning in the desired direction while regulating engine output power. It could move in any direction, accelerate quickly, hover and rotate on its axis, as well as remain aloft for up to 45 minutes, and travel at speeds of up to 60 mph. The United States Army evaluated it in the 1980s, but it was deemed inferior to the capabilities of helicopters and small, uncrewed aircraft, so the X-Jet program was halted.

The Radiant Energy Device

Dr. T. Henry Moray of Salt Lake City invented the first gadget to extract energy from the meta frequency oscillations of empty space in the early 1900s. Moray was eventually able to create a free energy gadget that weighed sixty pounds and generated 50,000 watts of electricity for several hours. Ironically, despite frequently demonstrating his gadget to scientists and engineers, Moray was unable to secure money to further develop the device into a usable power station capable of supplying electrical power on a large scale. Before World War II, Moray worked briefly with the Rural Electrification Agency on the machine's development. At the time, the R.E.A. was reportedly penetrated by Communist supporters and high-ranking officers with a distinctly pinkish tint. These officials repeatedly pressed Moray to pass over all details of his gadget to the Soviet Union, including arranging for high-level Soviet scientists to visit the Moray laboratory to view the device in action. On the initiative of the Communist-infiltrated R.E.A., one person‚Äîlet us call him ""Z""‚Äîspent about two months in Moray's laboratory and managed to gain Moray's full confidence. Moray eventually revealed most of the secrets of the manufacture of his special valve to ""Z""‚Äîthe only person in whom Moray had ever entirely confided. There is considerable evidence that ""Z"" was a Soviet operative, and that this was where the Soviets originally got the idea to construct the hyperspace amplifiers that would later be utilized in their psychotronic weapons.",The Brilliant,"['Forbidden Technologies and The Silencing of Their Inventors', 'discovery', 'inventions', 'unexplained', 'mysterious', 'universe', 'techology', 'facts', 'interesting', 'scientists discovery', 'inventors', 'silenced', 'innovations', 'myterious', 'creators', 'inventors and inventions', 'inventions guy', 'imgur inventions', 'simple inventions', 'mystery', 'science', 'terrifying discovery', 'inventions and inventors', 'history', 'historical', 'historical facts', 'weird history', 'secrets', 'tesla', 'energy', 'dark energy', 'gadgets', 'tools', 'Forbidden', 'Forbidden inventions']",27,2024-05-02T13:10:13Z,PT22M16S,1415766,1067,False,

About This Video:
I built a hut with two gabbled end walls made of mud, supporting a roof of wooden poles covered with fired clay barrel tiles. The video shows the entire project which took 2 and a half months of work. It begins with the making of a thatched A-frame hut as a workshop for making tiles. The tiles were made from clay and fired in a kiln made from bricks made in previous videos. A 2x2 m hut was then built by making two walls of mud in the shape of a wall and gable. Between 1.25 and 1.6 tons of soil were used to make these walls. The roof was formed by spanning the two walls with timber that was then covered with tiles. The hut shed rain reasonably well but it remains to be seen how it will fair in the long wet season which is starting now. The main benefit of this hut is how little material is used in the walls considering that there are no side walls, significantly reducing labor and materials. It will be an experiment in how this building method works.

About Primitive Technology:
Primitive technology is a hobby where you build things in the wild completely from scratch using no modern tools or materials. These are the strict rules: If you want a fire, use a fire stick - An axe, pick up a stone and shape it - A hut, build one from trees, mud, rocks etc. The challenge is seeing how far you can go without utilizing modern technology. I do not live in the wild, but enjoy building shelter, tools, and more, only utilizing natural materials. To find specific videos, visit my playlist tab for building videos focused on pyrotechnology, shelter, weapons, food & agriculture, tools & machines, and weaving & fiber.

Heat transfer occurs at a lower rate in materials of low thermal conductivity than in materials of high thermal conductivity.

About This Video:
I built Mud walls and capped them with roof tiles to protect them from rain. Mud walls if left uncovered in wet weather will dissolve in the rain and collapse. I wanted to test a solution to this problem by covering the walls with roof tiles. I start the video firring the roof tiles made in the previous video before making another batch to dry out ready for firing. Then I started building the mud walls by digging a foundation trench and filling it with rubble. The rubble was then capped with large stones completing the foundation. This was done so that water at ground level wouldn't wick up the mud wall and weaken it. The mud was then made from water and soil around the build site. The mud was then piled in layers about 5 cm thick and 25 cm wide to form 2 opposing walls 2.25 m long. When the wall was 75 cm high, the bricks were laid on one side of the tops of the walls and the tiles put on these in such a way as to give them a 30 degree slope. It then rained on the walls without ill effect. The tiles can be taken off and new layers added periodically. The mud wall capped with roof tiles seems to be a good process for building mud walls in a wet climate. Hopefully, it will work before a roof can be built over the walls. 

About Primitive Technology:
Primitive technology is a hobby where you build things in the wild completely from scratch using no modern tools or materials. These are the strict rules: If you want a fire, use a fire stick - An axe, pick up a stone and shape it - A hut, build one from trees, mud, rocks etc. The challenge is seeing how far you can go without utilizing modern technology. I do not live in the wild, but enjoy building shelter, tools, and more, only utilizing natural materials. To find specific videos, visit my playlist tab for building videos focused on pyrotechnology, shelter, weapons, food & agriculture, tools & machines, and weaving & fiber.

By contextualizing technological advancements within both societal and business landscapes, she unveils the current state of affairs and sheds light on what the future holds. Haar grote nieuwsgierigheid naar het menselijk gedrag en nieuwe technologische mogelijkheden leidde tot een glansrijke carri√®re in innovatie. Na vele innovatieprojecten bij grote bedrijven en startups raakte Deborah steeds meer ge√Ønteresseerd in de psychologische kant van innovatie: waarom omarmen sommige mensen technologische innovaties direct, terwijl anderen weerstand ervaren? Dit bracht haar op het snijvlak van psychologie, technologie en business. This talk was given at a TEDx event using the TED conference format but independently organized by a local community.

This week David, Dana and Max are joined by Bloomberg Technology co-host Ed Ludlow to take a deep dive into all things Tesla, in advance of today‚Äôs fateful earnings report. Things are looking increasingly bleak for the company and we'll soon know if the numbers match the mood set by last week's layoffs. Also discussed: BINGO!

Evidence suggested includes the alignment of the Giza pyramids with the stars of Orion's Belt, hinting at sophisticated astronomical knowledge, and the remarkable precision in the construction of these pyramids, suggesting advanced architectural and engineering techniques. Additionally, there are discussions about the potential use of advanced tools and methods for cutting and transporting massive stone blocks, which would require a level of technology not conventionally attributed to the ancient Egyptians of the well-known dynastic periods.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K3uiMsqptOs,Pre-Egyptian Technology Left By an Advanced Civilization That Disappeared,"The concept of an advanced pre-Egyptian civilization, existing before the well-documented dynastic periods of ancient Egypt, is supported by the advanced technological features of sites like the Osireion, Zawyet el Aryan, the Serapeum of Saqqara, and many others. this lost civilization might have had a profound understanding of astronomy, engineering, and mathematics, far beyond what was typical for the time. Evidence suggested includes the alignment of the Giza pyramids with the stars of Orion's Belt, hinting at sophisticated astronomical knowledge, and the remarkable precision in the construction of these pyramids, suggesting advanced architectural and engineering techniques. Additionally, there are discussions about the potential use of advanced tools and methods for cutting and transporting massive stone blocks, which would require a level of technology not conventionally attributed to the ancient Egyptians of the well-known dynastic periods.

Tesla Bots will be sent to work on the Moon, and A.I. chat bots will guide people into dreams that they can control (lucid dreams). And what happens when humanity forms a deeper understanding of dark energy, worm holes, and black holes. What type of new technologies could this advanced knowledge develop? Could SpaceX launch 100 Artificial Intelligence Starships, spread across our Solar System and beyond into Interstellar space, working together to form a cosmic internet, creating the Encyclopedia of the Galaxy. Could Einstein‚Äôs equations lead to technologies in teleportation, and laboratory grown black holes. 

Other topics covered in this sci-fi documentary video include: the building of super projects made possible by advancing fusion energy, the possibilities of brain chips, new age space technology and spacecraft such as a hover bike developed for the Moon in 2050, Mars colonization, and technology predictions based on black holes, biotechnology, and when will humanity become a Kardashev Type 1, and then Type 2 Civilization.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZEl-Y1NvBVI,Primitive Technology: Cord drill and Pump drill,"I made a cord drill and then upgraded it to a pump drill. A cord drill is basically a spindle with a fly wheel attached so it looks like a spinning top. the middle of a piece of cord is then put into a notch at the top of the spindle. The ends of the cord are then wrapped around the spindle and then pulled quickly outwards causing the drill to spin. The momentum of the fly wheel causes the cord to wrap back around the spindle in the other direction. When it stops the cords are pulled outwards again and the drill spins in the other direction.
I made the first one with a stone flywheel then made fire with it in the same way I make fire with fire sticks. Then I made and fired some clay fly wheels, made another drill with one of the fly wheels and fitted a stone drill bit to the end. This one I use for drilling holes in wood. 
I used the new drill to make a hole in a piece of wood. I then put the spindle of the original cord drill through the hole in the wood, tied the ends of the cord onto the piece of wood and it became a pump drill. The cords were wrapped round the spindle as normal but now a pumping action of the wooden cross bar created the same action.
This was an interesting project. For fire making I'd stick to fire sticks because the equipment is easier to make. But for people with soft hands they could use the cord drill as it won't give them blisters. It should be added that the pump drill actually took longer than the cord drill (cord: 32 seconds, pump 1 min 30 seconds -the pump drill scene was edited down to make it watchable). The pump drill had more moving parts and was constantly having problems. As a fire making method I'd choose the cord drill over the pump drill unless all the parts were well made.

 The main purpose I'd use these tool for is drilling holes rather than fire making. It was reasonably good but the stone bits I made could be improved and their attachment to the shaft also needs some thought. If the bit loosens and gets off axis slightly the whole thing wobbles. 
These drills are impressive inventions and show potential for carpentry use later on.

We bring to you the best videos from your favorite show Taarak Mehta Ka Ooltah Chashmah. So, get your daily dose of laughter with Jethalal, Taarak Mehta, Daya, Champaklal and their neighbors in Gokuldham Society.

About Taarak Mehta Ka Ooltah Chashmah:
--------------------------------------------------------------------
The show is inspired from the famous humorous column 'Duniya Ne Undha Chasma' written by the eminent Gujarati writer Mr. Tarak Mehta. This story revolves around daily happenings in ""Gokuldham Co-operative Society"" and covers topical issues which are socially relevant. The show predominantly - revolves around 'Jethalal' who is an uneducated Gujarati businessman. Your 'Taarak Mehta', is his neighbor. 'Jethalal' finds a friend and philosopher in 'Taarak Mehta' and often goes to him for advice whenever he is in trouble. Jethalaal's family includes his simpleton wife 'Daya Ben' and a mischievous son 'Tapu'. Tapu is a menace and a constant source of trouble to all the members of Gokuldham. They have often warned 'Jethalal' to reform 'Tapu' or else be prepared to leave the premises. Lost hopes of being heard by his son push Jethalal' to call his father 'Champaklal' from the village. This was his great idea of leashing some control over the mischievous Tapu. The opposite happens and the grandfather joins hands with the grandson to make life a roller coaster troublesome ride for Jethalal.

The fear is that this will lead US & EU companies to go bust. China has hit back, saying that there is no overcapacity in its 3 clean tech industries, and accusing some of these countries of being protectionist.

Who is right? Are we about to see a trade war erupt between EU and China, similar to what we had seen between the US and China?
